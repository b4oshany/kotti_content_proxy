===================
kotti_content_proxy
===================

This is an extension to the Kotti CMS that allows you to add "content proxies" to your Kotti site.

A content proxy is very similar to a *symbolic link* on UNIX systems.
It allows you to refer to a single content node from multiple places in your content tree without having to duplicate the content itself.
It will then show up in the navigation in multiple places, but still only exist once.

Setup
=====

To activate the kotti_content_proxy add-on in your Kotti site, you need to add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
Deploy config.
If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one.
The line in your ``[app:main]`` section could then look like this::

  kotti.configurators = kotti_content_proxy.kotti_configure

With this, you'll be able to add calendar and event items in your site.
